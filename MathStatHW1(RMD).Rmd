Very good; 18/18
**Instructions:** The entirety of this assignment must be submitted as an R Markdown file (.Rmd) on your GitHub repository.  Use the .Rmd note handout files and the R Markdown cheat sheet as guidelines.  You are encouraged to save this HW1.Rmd file and fill in the questions with your answers, then submit.  **I should be able to knit your .Rmd file and compile your code myself, so make sure you do some bug checks before submitting!** (I.e., knit the document yourself a couple times and search for errors.)

Consider Example 2 in the notes.  2 dice are rolled, one red and one white.  Let $Y$ be the random variable that denotes the maximum value of the two rolls.  We will use simulation to find the mean and variance of $Y$, and then verify that our simulated results match what we would expect theoretically.

**Theoretical section**

1. (3pts) Define the pmf, find $\mu = E(Y)$, $\sigma^2 = Var(Y)$, and $\sigma = SD(Y)$.  Show all your work.

```{r} 
 y <- 1:6
 py <- c(1/36, 3/36, 5/36, 7/36, 9/36, 11/36)
 
  mu <- sum(y*py)
  mu
 
  EY2 <- sum(y^2*py)
  EY2
 
  sigma2 <- EY2-mu^2
  sigma2
  
  sigma <- sqrt(sigma2)
  sigma

```

2. (2pts)  Use `ggplot()` to plot the pmf; see Handout 1 notes for an example.

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
y <- 1:6
py <- c(1/36, 3/36, 5/36, 7/36, 9/36, 11/36)
dd <- data.frame(y=y, probs = py)
ggplot(aes(x=y, y=probs), data=dd) + geom_bar(stat='identity') + ylab('P(Y=y)') + ggtitle(' pmf of Y ')

```

3. (2pts)  Consider the random variable $Z=2Y+1$.  What is $E(Z)$ and $Var(Z)$?  Show all work. 

```{r}
Ez = mu * 2 + 1
Ez

## Ez = 9.94

Varz = 2^2 * sigma2
Varz

## Varz = 7.88

```



**Simulation section**  


Write a function called `one.Y` that simulates rolling two dice and returns the maximum roll.  Try the function out a few times and include the results of these test-runs in your R Markdown output. I have written some code below to get you started; each line of "pseudo-code" should be repaced with actual code:

<!--NOTE: You should probably change the below code to eval=TRUE when you submit, else your function will not be compiled and your pdf/word/HTML file will not reproduce any output!  -->

```{r,eval=TRUE}
one.Y <- function() {
  
  sample.space <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  singleroll.red <- sample(sample.space, 1, replace=TRUE)
  singleroll.white <- sample(sample.space, 1, replace= TRUE)
  
 m <- max(singleroll.red, singleroll.white)
 return(m)
  
  }
one.Y()

```

Each of the following can be answered with 1-2 lines of R code (and corresponding output, of course)

4. (2pts) Use `replicate()` to simulate the results of 1000 pairs of rolls.  These are 1000 realizations of the random variable $Y$. Save the 1000 realizations in an object called `many.Y`.
```{r}
set.seed(2222)
many.Y <- replicate(1000, one.Y())
many.Y

```


5.  (2pts) Use `ggplot()` to create the empirical (i.e., observed) pmf of your simulation.  See Handout 1 for example R code.  How does it compare with your theoretical pmf?
```{r}
df <- data.frame(x=as.factor(many.Y))
ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(many.Y)),data=df) + geom_bar(aes(y=(..count..)/(sum(..count..)))) +
  ylab('Observed proportion') + xlab('y') + ggtitle('Simulated pmf')

```



6. (1pt)  What is the mean of the 1000 realizations?
```{r}
set.seed(2222)
many.Y <- replicate(1000, one.Y())
mean(many.Y)

```


7.(1pt)  What is the variance of the 1000 realizations?
```{r}
mean(many.Y^2)

var(many.Y)
```

8.  (1pt) What is the standard deviation of the 1000 realizations?
```{r}

standd <- sqrt(var(many.Y))
standd

```


9. (1pt)  Create a new object called `many.Z` that creates 1000 realizations of $Z$.
```{r}
set.seed(2222)
many.Z <- 2* many.Y +1
many.Z
```

10. (1pt)  What is the mean of $Z$?
```{r}

mean(many.Z)

```

11. (1pt)  What is the variance of $Z$?
```{r}
var(many.Z)
```

12. (1pt) Note that your simulated results should be similar to the theoretical quantities; if they aren't, re-check your R code!  What is the reason for any differences?
```{r}

#The simulated results are similar to the theoretical quantities. Smallest of errors in the simulations can cause a difference with the theoretical quantities.

```
